(a)
    (1)Command "aig" converts the representation of the internal nodes, the functions of internal nodes are represented by AIG after the conversion, however the whole circuit is still a logic network
       Command "strash" converts the whole circuit into AIG form
    (2)Command "bdd" converts the representation of the internal nodes, the functions of internal nodes are represented by BDD after the conversion, however the whole circuit is still a logic network
       Command "collapse" converts the whole circuit into BDD
(b)
    A structurally hashed AIG can be converted into a logic network with node function expressed in SOP by a single command "logic"
